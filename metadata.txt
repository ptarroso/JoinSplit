qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=JoinSplit relates a spatial layer with a matrix sharing a common field, and export the selected fields from the matrix as spatial layers.
about=The JoinSplit works by performing a table join between a spatial layer and a matrix (opened as a table in QGIS), and it exports each field from the matrix, or only those selected by the user, as an individual shapefile. This plugin is useful when a matrix of presence or counts of multiple entities (e.g. species observations) are available with an grid identifier (e.g. UTM square, custom grid ID, intersection of lat/lon with a grid, etc). The JoinSplit opens all layers in the Table of Contents and the user may choose a style file (exported from any other shapefile) to show the new layers. The plugin includes an example data set (more details in the homepage).
